#Installing Python And Writing Your First Program

#Install Python and a programming text editor and write a program that prints one line other than 'hello world' and then take two screen shots and upload them below. You should use the command line to execute your Python program. Please do *not* use IDLE, the Python Interpreter (>>>), or a short cut in your editor to run the code. Later in the class when we start reading files, we will need to be able to run Python programs from particular directories. See the videos for details. This assignment is worth 10 points. 6 points come from your peers and 4 points come from you grading other student's submissions.

print "Hello Claudio!"
